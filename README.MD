# Advent of Code 2018

My solutions to [these awesome puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/2018). To run the code, you need [Node v6+](https://nodejs.org). 

In the root run: 

```npm start <day?>```

If you skip the `day` parameter it will run current day of December 2018 (given that the date is less than 26).


*DISCLAIMER: The code is mostly optimized for speed and readability/clarity so it is more verbose than it could be. But sometimes readability is sacrificed for shortness too. There is no ideal solution for any of the tasks, so I tried to find a good balance between all the criteria.*
